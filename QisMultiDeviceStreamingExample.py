AN-032 - Application note demonstrating capture of power data from multile devices at the same time

Automated capture allows data from multiple instruments to be gathered at the same time, and with lower overhead than running QPS (Quarch Power Studio).
This example uses quarchpy functions to connect and pull data from a list of instruments on the network.

We demonstrate two capture modes:
simple_multi_stream_example() - This example streams each modules stream data to a CSV file for post-processing
multi_device_live_monitoring_example() - This example showcases live monitoring for select stream data

QIS is distributed as part of the Quarchpy python package and does not require separate install

########### VERSION HISTORY ###########

25/03/2025 - Nabil Ghayyda  - First Version

########### REQUIREMENTS ###########

1- Python (3.x recommended)
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
2- Quarchpy python package
    https://quarch.com/products/quarchpy-python-package/
3- Quarch USB driver (Required for USB connected devices on windows only)
    https://quarch.com/downloads/driver/
4- Check USB permissions if using Linux:
    https://quarch.com/support/faqs/usb/

########### INSTRUCTIONS ###########

1. Connect multiple Quarch power modules via USB/Ethernet.
2. Edit the script and hard-code the modules you'd like to stream with (edit myDeviceIDs list).
3. Optionally select the channels you want to monitor for live data (edit channelsToMonitor dict).
4. Run the script and follow any instructions on the terminal
